## Data for App

Please note that this app downloads the data directly from the official NHL API. Due to this, there is no raw folder as the data is downloaded and rendered when initializing the app. 

## App Description

Welcome to the NHL API App. This app is built to help fantasy hockey players dive into and compare stats between selected players in the league. When using the app, you can select 2 players in the NHL with the dropdown menu created. What this app does is allows you to compare the player performance for the first player with the player performance of the second player. This is a handy tool when preparing for your fantasy drafts to be better informed before drafting and picking players. Currently this app is capable of analyzing total goals, assists and points scored over the last 5 years. 

Installation instructions

Simply open the app.R file in the src folder using R Studio, and click the run app button on the top right to run the app.
